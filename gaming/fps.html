    <p>Call of Duty is a first person shooter game. It has a wide variety of game modes to play. The most popular is a battle royale called "Warzone." There are also games modes such as: "Search and Destroy," "Domination," and "Free-For-All." Users can select between a wide range of weapons to play however they would like to. I recommend this game to those who wish to not have to think too hard about what they are doing. I tend to get in a rythm when I play this game.</p>
    <h2>Rainbow Six Siege</h2>

    <p>Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter game that emphasizes teamwork. Players use unique tools and gadgets to either attack or defend a bomb site. Players are encouraged to communicate with their team to come up with strategies to win! There are over 60 operators to choose from. I recommend at least 30 - 45 minutes designated to each match. There are many ways to team up and win!</p>
