    <p>Minecraft is the ultimate sand-box game! I have the most fun playing this. There are literally infinite ways to play this game. To start, one can either play creative or survival. Creative allows the user to have access to every block and item in the game. Users mostly use this to mode to explore, create to the heart's content, or experiment. Survival on the other hand is focused on staying alive and protecting yourself from the many mobs in the game. The ultimate goal is to kill the enderdragon and claim its egg! I highly recommend this game to anyone who wishes to relax or even have fun with friends!</p>
    <h2>Roblox</h2>

Users can also create their own games. Roblox provides so many different games to be able to enjoy yourself! I recommend Roblox to those who are looking to explore different games.</p>
